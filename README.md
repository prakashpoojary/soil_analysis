# SoilApp

SoilApp is a Flutter application that addresses the modern farming challenges by providing real-time information about soil health using IoT technology. It offers a user-friendly mobile app interface for farmers to monitor and improve their crop yields sustainably.

## Project Description

Modern farming faces the challenge of increasing crop yields while also taking care of the soil's health in a sustainable way. This project tackles this challenge using an IoT-based approach. We use a multiparameter soil sensor that can check the quality of the soil. This sensor can measure things like Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, pH levels, moisture, Electrical Conductivity (EC), temperature, and humidity values using a DHT11 sensor. All these measurements help farmers understand how good the soil is for growing plants.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of soil parameters.
- Historical data analysis.
- Mobile app for easy access to information.
- Sustainable farming practices.
- Integration with IoT technology.
